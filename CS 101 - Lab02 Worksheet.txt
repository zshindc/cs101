1. Describe in your own words what the "half adder" circuit does.

In the "half adder" circuit, the carry output is only true when only both inputs x and y are true. If only either input x or input y are true, then the sum output is true. 


2. Describe in your own words what the "full adder" circuit does.

In the "full adder" circuit, the output sum is true only when one of the inputs or carry_in is true or if all inputs are true. 
The output "carry_out" is only true when any two inputs are true or when all inputs are true. 

3. What did you learn from putting together the ripple carry adder?

All inputs or outputs must be connected within the ripple carry adder in order to find the output sum. Different true inputs on the adders give different sum outputs.
